<p>Birth order is usually used as a proxy variable for parental investment, the assumption being that older siblings require parental attention. However, there are are reasons to doubt this, as fully-grown siblings probably do not compete for the same resources. To compute a clearer proxy variable of competing siblings, we computed and adjusted for the number of siblings who were alive and younger than five at the time of birth of the anchor child.</p>

<p>Inheritance is linked to birth order and being male in several of the historical populations. Here, we adjust for the anchor being the first or last born adult son in a family. This implies that we control for our outcome to a certain extent, as “adult sons” cannot have died before adulthood, but a paternal age effect on mortality could still be detected for siblings other than the first- and last-born adults.</p>

<h2><em>r9</em>: Continuous birth year adjustment</h2>
<p>In our main model, we control for birth cohort in 5-year-bins (lumping small bins). We chose to do so, because nonlinear and even sharply spiking effects of birth cohort are plausible (due to e.g. epidemics). This decision may be disputed, as it summarises 5-year-bins. Here, we instead allow for a thin-splate spline on the continuous birth year variable. This allows for smooth nonlinear (but not spiking) birth cohort effects.</p>

<h2><em>r10</em>: Group-level slope added</h2>
<p>Paternal age effects may vary between different families. Although we did not explore between-family moderators of paternal age effects in our study, we tested whether modelling an additional group-level slope for paternal age differences within the family, would change the results by allowing for shrinkage and to examine the amount of inter-family differences to be explained for potential future moderator analysis.</p>

<div id="r11_separate_random_effects_for_parents" class="section level2 tab-content">
<h2><em>r11</em>: Separate group-level effects for each parent</h2>
<p>Most anchors in our sample are full biological siblings and especially in the historical populations, divorce and remarriage was rare. Therefore, we chose to include only one group-level effect, for the parent couple (i.e. one group-level effect per father-mother-dyad). Including one intercept per parent is potentially a better way to adjust for genetic propensities inherited from either parent and allows estimating this propensity also from half-siblings, while half-sibling relationships were ignored in our main models. This comes at the cost of modelling complexity.</p>

<div id="r12_sex_moderation" class="section level2 tab-content">
<h2><em>r12</em>: Sex moderation</h2>
<p>It need not be the case that paternal age has the same effect on male and female children. For example, male children inherit only the small Y chromosome from the father, but female children inherit the larger X chromosome, so that paternal age predicts X-chromosomal de novo mutations in females but not in males (Francioli et al., 2016). At the same time, the autism literature suggests that males are less robust to heritable and de novo autism risk variants and that these effects are not simply due to having only one X chromosome (Werling &amp; Geschwind, 2015). Here we let a dummy variable for being male moderate the paternal age effect.</p>

<div id="r13_control_paternal_afb" class="section level2 tab-content">
<h2><em>r13</em>: Control paternal age at first birth</h2>
<p>We already control for the average paternal age at which the children in a family were born. The mean is a more complete summary of the reproductive timing of the father than the age at first birth. However, far more literature has examined age at first birth and it has the advantage of never being censored (although we of course try to rule out censoring by choosing appropriate subsets). Therefore, we added age at first birth as a covariate in this model.</p>

<div id="r14_compare_lfe" class="section level2 tab-content">
<h2><em>r14</em>: Compare lfe</h2>
<p>Most of the previous literature has not used multilevel modelling, but linear group fixed effects (essentially dummy variables on the many thousands of families in the model). We believe our multilevel modelling approach has the advantage of allowing us to examine the effect of including predictors at the level of the family in the same model.</p>
<p>This allows us to<br />
a) appropriately model a zero-inflated outcome such as number of children including those who died young (we’re not aware of a linear group fixed effect approach that handles hurdle or zero-inflated models)<br />
b) examine group-level slopes for paternal age and potentially to examine moderators at the level of the family (though we did not do this)<br />
c) explicitly model confounders at the level of the family (e.g. number of siblings).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the prevalence of this approach in the literature mandates that we show how our approach compares. We fit this model using the R package “<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lfe/">lfe</a>” and the function felm. All covariates that were not estimable in principle were removed (i.e. number of siblings, paternalage.mean).</p>

<h2><em>r15</em>: Using a moderator by region, group-level effects by parish</h2>
<p>In this model we attempted allow for regional variation in paternal age effects and attempted to better control residual variation. Our approach was two-fold: to moderate paternal age by region and to add a random effect for the church parish in which the individual was born.

<h2><em>r25</em>: Adjust for migration status</h2>
<p>In the three historical populations, records were kept in the parish. Although records were linked between parishes in all populations, except three out of four provinces in historical Sweden, migration might sometimes lead to censoring of records. Adjusting for migration may however constitute a partial adjustment for the outcome, as lower offspring fitness might make them more likely to migrate. Hence, we show the results of doing so as a robustness analysis. In all analyses, we adjusted for a “migrated”-dummy variable. Migration was differently defined depending on the population. In Québec, we had flags denoting immigrants and emigrants. Few immigrants were included in our analyses anyway, as we needed parental information for our analyses. Emigrants were people who left Québec. In historical Sweden, migration was logged as migration from the parish of birth. In the Krummhörn, we set migrated to true, when the parish of death/burial differed from the parish of birth/baptism.<br />
No migration information was available in 20th-century Sweden, but records there weren’t kept in parishes, so this should not pose a problem.</p>

<p>In reference to <em>m3</em>, the main reported model, the robustness models were implemented as follows: <em>r1</em> relaxed exclusion criteria (not in 20th-century Sweden), <em>r2</em> had only birth cohort as a covariate, <em>r3</em> adjusted for birth order as a continuous variable, <em>r4</em> adjusted for number of dependent siblings instead of birth order, <em>r5</em> interacted birth order with number of siblings, <em>r6</em> did not adjust for birth order, <em>r7</em> adjusted only for parental loss in the first 5 years, <em>r8</em> adjusted for being the first-/last-born adult son, <em>r9</em> adjusted for a continuous nonlinear thin-splate spline for birth year instead of 5-year bins, <em>r10</em> added a group-level slope for paternal age, <em>r11</em> included separate group-level effects for each parent instead of one per marriage, <em>r12</em> added a moderation by anchor sex, <em>r13</em> adjusted for paternal age at first birth, <em>r14</em> compared a model with linear group fixed effects, <em>r15</em> added a moderator by region and group-level effects by church parish (not in 20th-century Sweden), <em>r16</em> was restricted to Skellefteå (only in historical Sweden), <em>r17</em> simulated Down syndrome cases, <em>r18</em> reversed hurdle Poisson and Poisson distribution for the respective populations, <em>r19</em> used a normal distribution, <em>r20</em> did not adjust for maternal age, <em>r21</em> adjusted for maternal age as a continuous variable, <em>r22</em> relaxed exclusion criteria and included 30 more years of birth cohorts, allowing for more potential censoring, <em>r23</em> used Student’s t distributions for population-level priors and half-Cauchy priors for the family variance component, <em>r24</em> used noninformative priors, which should lead to results comparable with maximum likelihood, <em>r25</em> controlled for migration status (not in 20th-century Sweden).</p>
